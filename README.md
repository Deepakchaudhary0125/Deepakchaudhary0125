Hi, Deepak here! I'm currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at NIT Jalandhar, with a strong focus on VLSI design and Digital Hardware systems.

I'm proficient in C, C++, Python, and Verilog, and have hands-on experience using tools like Cadence, LTspice, and Arduino IDE.
I'm currently working on projects involving SPI-UART protocol design and a face recognition-based attendance system that combines hardware logic with practical applications.
